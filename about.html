      In 2019, Veronica Garza (17), Georgia Russello (15), and Maddy Poon (13) founded the “B”. Our mission is to inspire and inform the future leaders of our world. We want to provide educational resources for young adults who want to be the change they want to see in the world.
<br>
<br>
  In order to create a positive change, younger generations need to be informed about the world around them and become inspired to take action. Our world is like a beehive, hence the “B”, and we need to work together in order to survive. The “B” hopes to be an outlet for young adults who lack the resources as well as an outlet for people who want to become involved in current events, whether that be a senior in high school applying to college, a ten-year-old curious about current events, or a thirty-year-old wishing to help younger generations.
<br>
<br>
  Our beehive is a place for everyone. Find your place in the hive today!
